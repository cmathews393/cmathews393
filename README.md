# Hi, I'm Chloe 👋

## About Me

I am a DevOps Engineer with a focus in process automation and tooling. I currently work at an MSP doing automation and small webapps. I prefer working in Python 🐍, but I also know some Javascript+TypeScript (As well as HTML and Bootstrap/CSS). I don't work with it very often, but I also know some C#, and have been trying to learn Rust 🦀.

## My Projects

When I'm not working on things at my job, I spend my time working on a bunch of half finished projects that might eventually do something, most notably Spotiplex :)

Outside of my side projects and work, I like to read, watch movies, and listen to music. You can check out my goodreads for what I'm reading, and what I've read, but some of my favorites recently have been:

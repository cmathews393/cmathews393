# Hi, I'm Chloe 👋

## About Me

I am a Python developer and systems administrator. I currently work at an MSP doing automation and small webapps. I prefer working in Python 🐍, but I also know a little bit of Javascript (As well as HTML and Bootstrap/CSS). I don't work with it very often, but I also know some C#, and have been trying to learn Rust 🦀.

## My Projects

When I'm not working on things at my job, I spend my time working on Spotiplex, and some other smaller projects. I'm also currently beginning work on a project to condense some scripts and smaller projects (including Spotiplex) into a single unified app to manage Plex and Arr interactions.
